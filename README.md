# Drought_Monitoring_App
India Drought Monitor is a web-based dashboard for visualizing predicted drought conditions across Indian states using machine learning outputs. The system aggregates multi-source data, including vegetation indices, soil moisture, and standardized precipitation indices, to estimate drought severity for each region and month between 2024 and 2026.  The backend generates prediction data and serves it as JSON, while the frontend renders an interactive Leaflet map that is color coded by drought severity category. Users can select a state, time scale, and month to explore how conditions evolve and to identify areas at higher risk. Additional pages describe the datasets, model pipeline, and visualization options.  This project is intended as a prototype decision-support tool for researchers, students, and policymakers interested in agricultural drought monitoring in India.
